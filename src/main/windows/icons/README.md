# Windows Icon Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the Windows application icon (app.ico).

To create a proper Windows icon:

1. **Design Requirements:**
   - Multiple resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels
   - 32-bit color with alpha channel support
   - Clean, recognizable design that works at small sizes

2. **Tools:**
   - Free: GIMP with ICO plugin, Paint.NET with ICO plugin
   - Commercial: Adobe Photoshop, IcoFX, Axialis IconWorkshop

3. **Creation Steps:**
   - Design the icon at 256x256 pixels
   - Create versions at smaller sizes with appropriate simplification
   - Save as .ico file with all sizes embedded
   - Place as `app.ico` in this directory

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Use vector graphics for scalability
   - Ensure visibility on both light and dark backgrounds
   - Test at all sizes, especially 16x16 and 32x32
   - Consider Windows 11 design guidelines

5. **Recommended Colors:**
   - Use your brand colors
   - Ensure sufficient contrast
   - Consider accessibility guidelines

Once created, the Windows installer will automatically use this icon for:
- Application executable
- Desktop shortcut
- Start menu entry
- Control Panel entry
- Taskbar/system tray
